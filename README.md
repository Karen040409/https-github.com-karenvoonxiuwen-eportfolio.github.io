# ASSIGNMENT 1-POSTER
Reflection:

After our first industry talk, we were told to do the first assignment , create a poster related to the first industry talk. In this industry talk, I had gained a lot of information from the industry talk. For example, the jobscope of different position and the technology used in their company. The speaker gived us some advice on what should we do when we start working in an IT company.

#ASSIGNMENT 3-INDUSTRY TALK 2

REFLECTION:

In this industry talk 2, I had got a lot of information and advice from Ms Qistina, she is a system developer in TM. I also get to know the possible job opportunity in system development field. Besides, I also learn about what technologies and tools they are using. For example, they use PostgreSQL to develop a database engine and closely related components. System developer is a job that required continuous learning, I hope I can be like Ms Qistina in the future.

#ASSIGNMENT 4-NEWSPAPER

REFLECTION:

On 18th January 2024, our section had visited the new workplace of Clarity Techworks Company in Iskandar Puteri. We had the opportunity to visit their workplace and meet staff members in person. We had been divided into group and we look around with our leader. Every team give a clear and informative presentation about their team using slideshow and examples. They also answer our question and doubt patiently. In addition, we also manage to hear a speech from the CEO of Clarity Techworks. The CEOâ€™s speech inspired me a lot.

# DESIGN THINKING PROJECT -SCAM KILLER

REFLECTION:

During the starting phase, I felt that the design thinking project is a heavy project for us and we need to spend a lot of effort on this design thinking project. After we had done the design thinking assignment, I realize that the project is easier than I think when we work in group and cooperate well with each other. This project required creative thinking skill and it also train us to work in group. I think this indeed helps a lot in our future.

# PC ASSEMBLE

REFLECTION:

On 2nd November 2023, our section had conducted a PC assemble in N28. I had learned how to assemble and dissemble a computer case correctly. Besides, I also got to know the proper name of different component in the computer case. During the session, lecturers and assistants help us a lot by telling us how to take out the components correctly and what should we pay attention on. At the end, all of the group manage to dissemble and reassemble the computer case.
